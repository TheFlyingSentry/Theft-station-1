[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

This is the "short" form of the rules, which has all the information any regular player should need. You can find the "long" form of the rules with more examples & clarifications of any ambiguity on our Discord.
Should you need it. Some RP-specific documents available on the wiki such as Space Law, the Standard Operating Procedure, and the Alert Procedure will be mentioned here and are expected to be followed.

[color=#ff0000]Recent Changes[/color]
    - Additional rule clarifcations available on the Discord, or ping Liltenhead for any questions.

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins may excercise discretion with rules as they see fit. If you rule lawyer or line skirt, you will get removed.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, or anything even remotely similar. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED) (Leeway is given to insults, ex: 'You are a dickhead', do not push it)

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming". Adminstrators cannot police metacommunications, we must assume it is being abused. (ALL INVOLVED WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months and only with a voucher of good behavior from another SS13/SS14 server. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt/crash the round/server. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with spam messages, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"). Hostility to administators in the relay will likely result in your removal. All admin helps are sent to the Harmony Discord relay.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 0: Don't be a dick[/color]
Practice common sense while consulting these rules. The general idea counts, not the exact wording. The rules are guidelines for the server and should be interpreted to suit the situation at hand, not manipulated to suit your needs. Attempting to Rules-Lawyer an Administrator is never a good idea, and likely to result in harsher punishment

The Server Staff retains the right to issue Permanent Bans to players that they consider to be a consistent net negative to the community and server, without the need for any specific Rule to be broken.

The Staff Members have final say on the server. If you are banned or job banned from the server. Ban appeals will be handled on the Discord. 

The Adminhelp system is not to be spammed. If you do not get a response, the Administrators are either busy with other matters or not available.

When in doubt, Adminhelp any question you may have about the Server Rules.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 1: Roleplaying Standards[/color]
The following behaviors are prohibited on Harmony:

Metagaming (using OOC information acquired via means unavailable to other players. Examples include, but are not limited to, third-party software or direct, physical communication). Streaming is allowed. 

Placing current round information into OOC chat (IC in OOC);

Using LOOC to talk to others to give them current round information. This applies to Ghosts as well. If you want to provide minor instruction to a nearby player, please inform the Server Staff before doing so.

Using multiple accounts for yourself during a round (Multikeying) is not allowed.

When it comes to suiciding, do not suicide upon getting caught, or when converted by a conversion Antagonist.

Harmony is a medium role-playing server. You’re not expected to be 100% immersed in everything that is happening. However, we still expect players to act in character at all times, in a manner befitting Space Station 14. The game has many clashing themes and many unserious tones, but generally try to take things as seriously as you would if you were in your character’s shoes. 

We do not restrict knowledge of any antagonists, but you may pick and choose what your character knows. Job knowledge is restricted within reason; for example, an engineer should not know how to make complex medicines. In an extreme crisis or to save your own life, you may stretch this information. 

New Life Rule is in effect, you remember all events up until you fall unconscious unless you enter a dead state. Being defibrillated will return all your memories except for the events leading up to your death. You may remember vague descriptors of who or what killed you. Examples include: Shot, stabbed, burned. You may also describe crew member, borg, or a mob species like carp. Avoid going into specifics like species or gender of crew members though. Being cloned/borged will make your character forget everything since the shift started.

Administrators may ask you to change your behavior if it is seen by the Server Staff as damaging the IC atmosphere of the server. Examples include, but are not limited to: references to memes or real life events, reference characters (Gregory House, Walter White), or inappropriate play on words. 

Your character is an employee of Nanotrasen. Names should be context-appropriate and support appropriate role-play. Stage names have more creative freedom. This includes roles like the clown, mime, and musician.

If you think a name should be allowed that an admins thinks of otherwise, this can be sent for review. However, until the review is finalized, the decision of the admin at the time remains.

Netspeak should be avoided, unless you’re writing on a PDA or piece of paper. 

[color=#a4885c]Power Gaming[/color]
Powergaming can simply be defined as putting your own mechanical advantages ahead of other people's enjoyment or the development of engaging role-playing scenarios. It should be avoided in favor of strategies that both encourage and promote the enjoyment of all parties involved. Administrators may ask you to tone down your play if it is disruptive, or a pattern of power gaming is noticed. 

[color=#a4885c]Flavour Text[/color]
Your character's flavor text should only contain information that any other character couldn’t notice at a glance. The flavor text shouldn't contain any information about a feature (like personality, past, and so on) that isn't immediately apparent.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 2: SSD Players[/color]
SSD Players are players that have disconnected from the game. They can be identified by examining them, which will reveal yellow text indicating they might return. 

You may not touch or interact with people under the influence of 'Sudden Sleep Disorder' except to pull them to a Cryosleeper, to provide medical care to SSD players, such as medication or surgery, or to remove them from an immediate life threatening situation, such as a plasma fire.

Antagonists may loot non-antag SSD players, but looting the captain, who clearly crashed in a public hall, is not fun gameplay for anyone. If they are your target, feel free to do what you have to. 
If the person goes SSD immediately after an arrest, you are free to continue processing and brigging them as if they were still awake.

If you believe an SSD person needs to be interacted with (such as an SSD Captain needing to have their equipment removed), ask the Administrators first.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 3: Maintaining a Respectful Environment[/color]
Under no circumstances is OOC harassment of another player allowed, regardless of who the victim is. Repeated IC harassment with little to no reason can be considered metagrudging;

Racial, Homophobic, Ethnic, Religious, etc, slurs are not allowed ICly or OOCly. Terms such as "f-slur" and "n-slur", or any variations on them are strictly prohibited. Speciesism is also prohibited. 

Be respectful to everyone. Every character is played by a real human being. Frustration is natural and a part of roleplay, but actively harassing someone can leave a bad impression. Reserve anger in OOC, and try to remain constructive whenever possible. 

[color=#ff0000]Rule 4: Play your role[/color]
Only choose a role you’re actually wanting to play a round of. 

Choosing to play as a Head of Staff (such as Chief Medical Officer) means you will be expected to play to a higher standard of roleplay, seriousness and competence. You may be banned from Command if you fail to meet these standards, or if you ignore your duties.

If you need to leave the round early as a Head of Staff, you must inform Command and place yourself in cryo. If you cannot do this for any reason, then instead Ahelp prior to leaving so that an administrator can remove you after logging out. Things happen, so don’t stress too much if something in real life is more important than logging out of the funny space game.

Stay in your lane. If you pick a doctor, you’re expected to do your duty of being a medical doctor. Breaks are encouraged; not everyone needs to be constantly on edge waiting to do their job. Interacting with other departments is heavily encouraged, as is spending time at the bar, etc. However, in cases of emergencies, your job should take priority over most social roleplay scenarios, like getting a drink at the bar. 

The captain and members of security are expected to follow and have a good understanding of space law. This server doesn’t have a standard operating procedure; in general, you should be following the alert procedure and keeping the station running as intended. 

Following, or failing to follow standard operating procedure is an IC issue, and should be dealt with in character. If someone is being very negligent or extremely incompetent, feel free to ahelp. 

The order of the Laws determine their priority for cyborgs, with higher priority laws being displayed first. If one contradicts another, you are to follow the highest on the list. Common sense is to be used with all default Lawsets as they have been installed by NT for the protection of the station and their interests. 

Cyborgs are expected to follow the same guidelines as organic crewmembers charged with those tasks, unless their laws state otherwise (eg, Engineering Cyborgs should follow the same guidelines as organic Engineers). 

Frequently joining a round, only to then leave or commit suicide if you did not get an antag role is called is not permitted.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 5: Play Antagonists Responsibly[/color]
Remember the goal of an Antagonist is to make the round exciting, fun, and dangerous, within limits. You should make an effort to add to the round, as opposed to simply completing your objectives and carrying on normally.

The role of the antagonist may pit you against the station. However, this does not mean killing the entire station to steal a jetpack, as you must work towards your objectives, not general chaos. You may antagonize or murder specific people who will help you complete your objective or who are hindering you from completing said objective. You are also permitted to freely defend yourself with lethal force and need not escalate as a normal crewmember would.

The Die a Glorious Death objective essentially permits whatever you want. It is rare for a reason. 

If you are not willing to act as an antag, do not check on antagonist roles. If you accidentally roll an antag and do not wish to play it, please ahelp it. 

Team-based antagonists (such as Nuclear Operatives) are expected to ahelp if they need to leave the round, or communicate with their team that they need to leave. Their deaths are required for the round to end if they are to fail. 

Lone Antagonists (Traitors, Ninjas, Lone Operative, Terminators) are under no obligation to work together, and are free to attack/hinder/mess with one another. Team antagonists must work together. 

Antagonists are permitted to assist other antagonists with their objectives.;

Releasing the singularity or the tesla, tampering with atmospherics, large scale destruction, or any other action that directly warrants a shuttle call, should be limited to late in the round, and only if you have completed all of your objectives. Don’t release the tesla in “hopes” you kill your targets. Game ending antagonists such as the space dragon, or nuclear operatives may destroy whatever they see fit. 

Antagonists are free to pursue their objectives even on the evacuation shuttle. 

Arrivals, and the immediate area surrounding it is off limits to any form of antagonist behavior. Let people join the round. 

[color=#ff0000]Rule 6: Self-Antagging[/color]
Some forms of Self-Antagging may be highly subjective. An Administrator may warn you if your general behavior over multiple rounds is becoming a problem. If you need more clarification as to what behavior is a problem, you're highly encouraged to talk to the Server Staff about this.

[color=#a4885c]General Rules[/color]
Minor criminal activity is allowed as a non-antagonist. However, it will be considered self-antagging if it negatively affects a significant portion of the crew, puts the station at risk, or is done without any reasonable IC justification and/or provocation.

There will be no end of round grief. Even at central command, you are to stay in character until the lobby screen pops up. Antagonists may continue their objectives if it makes sense in character. Don’t try to kill every single person evacing after the end screen pops up. 

Stealing high-value items (such as the hand teleporter or nuke disk) is generally considered self-antagging, as it is fulfilling the syndicate's objectives. 

Breaking people out of the general brig area is an IC issue. Breaking people out of the permanent brig would be considered self antagging. 

Resisting arrest as a non-antagonist is allowed, but you may not escalate to lethal force. 

Actively diverting Security personnel and resources away from an active and direct antagonist threat in order to deal with you and your actions will be considered self-antag as it is putting the station at risk and aiding the antagonist. 

[color=#a4885c]Escalation rules[/color]
Murder is not acceptable for non-antags. Killing should only be done to protect a life, during an authorized execution, or in any situation security has to employ lethal force. 

Violence capable of inflicting serious damage to someone, especially anything that places them into a critical state, is reserved for Antagonists.

Self-defense is allowed to the extent of saving your own life or the life of another. All conflicts end once one participant enters a critical state. You are to make sure the critically injured person receives proper medical attention, unless it would be unreasonable for you to do so (you are also very injured, they are an antagonist, it would be unsafe to do so, etc.).

Minor assault and fistfights are acceptable, assuming that both players have a reasonable justification as to why the fight started. Assault without any provocation is to be considered a random death match (RDM) and is against server rules. 

The clown and mime are meant to entertain. Minor pranks are permitted, as long as you aren’t directly harming another crew member from doing their job. You are meant to entertain, not be a public annoyance all the time. 

Actions like kidnapping, stabbing someone with a screwdriver, or slipping people who are fighting active threats should be avoided. Deliberately hampering the crew during a red alert or higher, gives them justification to respond with equal force.

[color=#ff0000]Rule 7: Validhunting[/color]
It is only the job of Security to stop antagonists. If you are not a member of Security, then hunting Antagonists is not something you should be doing. You may not drop your job, or go out of your way, to hunt Antagonists. You may, however, protect yourself or others from Antagonist attack if you happen to witness it.

In the case of protecting yourself from an antagonist, don’t make an extended effort to chase down an antagonist. If they are no longer an active threat to you or others near you, it is not your job to go and chase them down. Let security handle the antagonists whenever possible. 

Any form of non-antagonist sentient animals must acquire permission from the Head of Security and Captain before assisting with security matters. You are allowed to defend yourself if either you or your owner are attacked, but valid hunting rules still apply unless you have been given permission. 

Antagonists that seek to destroy the station itself or kill the entire crew are exempt from the valid hunting rule, as they may require dozens of crew members to stop them. However, doctors should generally try to treat patients first and fight second. This goes for all jobs; engineers keeping the lights on may save more lives in the end.

Evidence of antagonist activity is required before you take steps to treat anyone as an antagonist. For example, just having syndicate pajamas is not proof of an antagonist. 

[color=#ff0000]Rule 8: Erotic Content[/color]
Generally, avoid anything that can come off as erotic. Don’t say things like, “They’re raping me!” Lighter forms of affection like hugs and kisses are appropriate, but anything more than that will be crossing the line. Keep things platonic. 

Sexual terms may be used in the form of insults, but keep them tasteful. Things like “captain can go fuck themselves” but avoid saying more direct things like, “suck my dick.”.
